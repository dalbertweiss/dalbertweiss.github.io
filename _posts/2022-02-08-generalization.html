<p>While the of implementation and training deep learning models becomes more easy to 
    accomplish the generalization of deep learning still remains an active research field.
    This specificially concerns the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) which by
    Schmidthuber has often been assosciated with a flat minima during training [1]. However, this
    thesis has largely been dismissed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06219.pdf/">[2]</a>.
    

    During this article I would like to discuss some approaches that has arrised for gener

<!---Occam’s Razor
Minimum Description Length principle
Kolmogorov Complexity

<h2 class="section-heading">Classical approaches</h2>
<h3 class="subsection-heading">Flat Minima</h3>
In 1997 Sepp Hoch__ and Schmidthuber studied the local, geometrical properties 
during optimization of deep learning with the assumption that reason for generalization
well is correlated with converging to a flat minima. This hypothesis is supposed to come
from the fact that the flat minima tends to be more stable.

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
